<div class="para">Each Example in the text is followed by a similar Checkpoint for you to try yourself. There are also Activities that can be used in a classroom setting. If you are reading the book on your own, we hope you will try at least some of the Practice problems; keep pencil and paper handy to jot down your thoughts and calculations. Once again, learning occurs most efficiently, especially in mathematics, if you engage actively with the material.</div>
