<div class="para">We are given the circumference of a circle and asked to find its radius. First we'll find the diameter of the circle, using the formula <span class="process-math">\(C = \pi \times d\text{.}\)</span>  We substitute the value of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\alert{500}\)</span> yards, and solve the formula for <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span>

\begin{align*}
\alert{500} \amp = \pi \times d ~~~~~~~~~~~\blert{\text{Divide 500 by } \pi}\\
d \amp = \dfrac{500}{\pi}

<div class="para">Use your calculator to find that  is approximately 150.15 yards. Because the radius of a circle is half its diameter, we divide 150.15 by 2 to find that the radius is 79.58 yards. The distance to the gazebo from the edge of the pond is about 79.6 yards.</div>
