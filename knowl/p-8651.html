<div class="para">This fact makes sense if we think in terms of money, with negative numbers representing debts.  Suppose you have a net worth of $200, after writing a check for $500 to repay a loan from your father. Then your father calls to say “As your graduation present, I’ve decided to cancel your $500 debt, so keep the money.” You now have $700. Subtracting a debt of $500 has the same effect as adding $500 to your account!</div>
