<div class="para">This book is meant for anyone who wants to refresh his or her basic math skills. Or for anyone who would like to increase their understanding of the principles behind those skills and why they work. The book can be used as a textbook for college students or other adults, or it can be used for individual study. The sections are largely independent, so a reader can pick and choose topics of interest.</div>
